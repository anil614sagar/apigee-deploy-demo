Feature:
	Httpbin.org exposes various resources for HTTP request testing
	As Httpbin client I want to verify that all API resources are working as they should

	Scenario: Setting headers in GET request
		Given I set User-Agent header to apickli
		When I GET /mock/v10
		Then response body path $.headers.User-Agent should be apicklis
